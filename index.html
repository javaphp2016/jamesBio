    <div class="container" style="display: block; size: 30px; background-color: gray; padding: 50px;">
        <p style="color: white; text-align: justify; font-size: 25px; font-family: courier;">James Alan Hetfield was born in Downey, CA (a suburb of Los Angeles) on August 3, 1963, to Christian Science parents, a religion he would dismiss later on. Feeling isolated from his high school classmates (and in the wake of his mother's death when he was a teenager), Hetfield turned to playing guitar and the sounds of '70s heavy metal: Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy, Aerosmith, AC/DC, UFO, and Blue Oyster Cult. His enlistment in a few garage bands followed (two being Obsession and Leather Charm), yet didn't lead to much. But he would soon find a kindred musical spirit from an ad in the local music paper placed by a L.A.-by-way-of-Denmark drummer/metal fan, Lars Ulrich. Ulrich turned Hetfield on to the sounds of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement (Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Motorhead, Diamond Head, Venom, Saxon, Angel Witch, etc.) and the two set out to form a similarly styled group together that would be a reaction against all the glam metal bands that were infiltrating Los Angeles. The result would be one of the most popular rock bands of all-time, Metallica.</p>
